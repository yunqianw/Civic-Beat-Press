         			<h2>Media Exposure</h2>

                    <p>We do have a bias and a point of view. More often than not, we side with underrepresented people and groups rather than with those who have access to structures of power. We’re proponents of internet freedom and open source, Creative Commons initiatives. We support gay marriage and women’s rights but think there’s a great deal more to be done to promote social, economic and political equality. Our writers and researchers come from different backgrounds and cultures, but we strive as much as possible to represent all sides equally, so long as those sides are backed by research and not hate or misrepresentation.

                    But most of all, we believe that humor, joy and creativity are a valid and necessary form of civic expression. The world can be a serious place, but we shouldn’t overlook the power of humor and creative expression in igniting a discussion or changing a person’s mind or simply helping us get through a difficult situation.
